# Mission: First Contact (REPL)

## The Objective
Engage with the Agent in a Read-Eval-Print Loop.

## The Challenge
1.  Launch `gptme` (no arguments).
2.  Say "Hello".
3.  Ask "What is your current working directory?".
4.  Exit the session.

## Hints
*   Exit command: `/exit` or `Ctrl+D`.
*   The agent uses the `shell` tool to find the directory.

## Verification
The agent should successfully print the path (e.g., `/Users/samir/...`).
