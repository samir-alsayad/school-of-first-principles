# Mission: File Manipulation

## The Objective
Use the Agent's tools to create and read files.

## The Challenge
1.  Launch `gptme`.
2.  Instruct the agent: "Create a file `mission_log.txt` with the text 'Captain's Log: Stardate 42'."
3.  Instruct the agent: "Read `mission_log.txt`".
4.  Verify the content is correct.

## Constraints
*   Do NOT use your text editor.
*   The Agent MUST do the work using `save` and `read` tools.

## Verification
You should see the tool output in the terminal:
`// save: mission_log.txt`
`// read: mission_log.txt`
