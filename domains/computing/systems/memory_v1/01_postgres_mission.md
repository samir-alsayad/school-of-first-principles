# Campaign 12: Postgres Mastery (The Deep Memory)
# Gate I: Intent (The Charter)
# Status: DRAFT

## 1. Context (The Why)
**Parent Campaign**: [Sovereign Memory](../../../03_memory/)
Our Agent Council currently lacks a long-term, structured memory.
We need to master **Postgres** and **pgvector** to build the **Sovereign Memory System**.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
id: mod-01-postgres-charter
requirements:
  - **REQ-01**: Persistent vector storage (Embeddings).
  - **REQ-02**: Relational linking (Thought -> File).
  - **REQ-03**: High-performance search.
  - **REQ-04**: SQL Transparency.

## 3. The Network Effect (Downstream Beneficiaries)
*   **Target**: [Sovereign Intelligence](../../../02_intelligence/)
    *   *Deliverable*: `IntelHub-Memory` (The Vector Store).
*   **Target**: [Sovereign Interface](../../../04_interface/)
    *   *Deliverable*: `nexus-db-viewer` (SQL TUI).

## 4. Design Spec
<!-- DEFERRED -->
[ ] Table Structure?
[ ] Indexing Strategy?
[ ] Python Driver Choice (SQLAlchemy vs Psycopg3)?
