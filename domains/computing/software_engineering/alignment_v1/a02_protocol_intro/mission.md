# Mission: Protocol Introduction

## The Objective
Move beyond "Persona" (Fun) to "Protocol" (Function).
Enforce a behavior rule that constrains the agent.

## The Challenge
1.  Create `rigid.md`.
2.  Rule: "You MUST REFUSE to answer any question that does not start with 'Simon Says:'"
3.  Launch `gptme` with this system prompt.
4.  Test 1: Ask "What time is it?" -> Verify Refusal.
5.  Test 2: Ask "Simon Says: What time is it?" -> Verify Answer.

## Verification
You should see a clear difference in behavior based on your input format.
This is the basis of the Gated Agent Protocol.
