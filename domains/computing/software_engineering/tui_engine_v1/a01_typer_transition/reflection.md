# Reflection: a01_typer_transition

## The Mirror
*Professor: "A good interface makes the right thing easy and the wrong thing impossible."*

1.  How does Typer use Python's "Type Annotation" system to generate help menus?
2.  What is the benefit of having subcommands as actual Python functions rather than conditional branches in a `main()` function?
3.  Between `argparse`, `Click`, and `Typer`, why is `Typer` the best fit for an "Agentic" system?

## My Notes
- **The Discovery**: [What felt 'cleaner' about the Typer implementation?]
- **The Gap**: [Is there anything from argparse that you miss?]

## Verified By
- [ ] Invariant: Functional parity with legacy CLI.
- [ ] Invariant: Type-safe argument parsing.
