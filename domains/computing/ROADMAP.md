# Sovereign Architect Knowledge Graph

This is the backend repository of knowledge for the School of First Principles.

## 🧠 The Taxonomy
This library is organized into four classical domains. The GAP Tutor dynamically generates personalized learning paths from these atoms.

### 🧩 [Fundamentals](knowledge_graph/Fundamentals/)
*The atoms of logic and language.*
- **Logic**: NAND, Gates, ALU.
- **Python**: Variables, Loops, Types.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples.

### ⚙️ [Systems](knowledge_graph/Systems/)
*The machine substrate.*
- **Hardware**: VRAM Physics, CPU Architecture.
- **OS**: PIDs, Persistence, Daemons, Signals.
- **Networks**: Sockets, Protocols, Web.
- **Databases**: Postgres, Vector Storage.

### 🏗️ [Software Engineering](knowledge_graph/Software_Engineering/)
*Patterns, architecture, and alignment.*
- **Protocols**: Gated Agent Protocol (GAP).
- **Security**: ACLs, Enforcers, Sterile Containment.
- **Patterns**: Polymorphism, Composition, Assembler.
- **Toolkits**: Typer, Rich, Jinja2.

### 🤖 [Artificial Intelligence](knowledge_graph/AI/)
*Cognition and local inference.*
- **Inference**: MLX, Quantization.
- **Reasoning**: Recursive Language Models (RLM).
- **Orchestration**: Specialist Councils, Feedback Loops.

## 🚀 Student Interaction
1. **Goal**: "I want to build [Project X]."
2. **Compilation**: GAP retrieves required nodes from the Graph.
3. **Execution**: A personalized `campaign/` is generated for you.
