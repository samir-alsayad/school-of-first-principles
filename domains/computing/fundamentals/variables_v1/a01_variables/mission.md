# Mission: Variable Translation

## The Objective
You know `int x = 10;` in Java/C.
Your mission is to write a Python script that declares variables without types, prints them, and demonstrates dynamic typing.

## The Challenge
Create a file `demo.py` that:
1.  Sets a variable `x` to `10`.
2.  Prints `x`.
3.  Changes `x` to `"Gap Protocol"` (String).
4.  Prints `x` again.

## Hints
*   Python print function: `print(value)`
*   No semicolons needed.
*   No `int` or `String` keywords needed.

## Verification
Run: `python3 demo.py`
Expected Output:
```
10
Gap Protocol
```
