# Module 01: Python Environment Mastery
# Campaign: 01_foundation (The Machine)
# Gate I: Intent (Charter)
# Status: DRAFT

## 1. Context
The user is confused about where to install packages (`pip`) and how to manage environments (`venv`, `conda`, `uv`).
Without this, every project becomes a dependency hell.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
id: mod-01-python-env-charter
requirements:
  - **REQ-01**: The User SHALL understand the difference between System Python and Virtual Environments.
  - **REQ-02**: The User SHALL be able to create, activate, and destroy a local `.venv`.
  - **REQ-03**: The User SHALL know how to freeze dependencies into `requirements.txt`.
  - **REQ-04**: The School SHALL adopt a standard Environment Protocol (e.g., `uv` or `venv` in project root).

## 3. The Network Effect
*   **Target**: [Sovereign Memory](../../03_memory/)
    *   *Deliverable*: A clean environment for `pgvector` experiments.
*   **Target**: [Sovereign Intelligence](../../02_intelligence/)
    *   *Deliverable*: Handling massive torch dependencies for LLMs.

## 4. Design Spec
