# Campaign M02: Environment Migration
**Pillar**: 01_foundation

## 🚀 Intent
To resolve the naming collisions and path integrity issues caused by legacy folder structures. This campaign focuses on "The Great Separation"—isolating the `IntelHub` and standardizing all sibling projects.

## 📂 Structure
*   **[Foundry](foundry/)**: The Casting Guide for the Hub isolation.
*   **[Lab](lab/)**: Dependency audits and surgical rename scripts.
*   **[Codex](codex.md)**: The map of existing and new environments.

## ⚙️ Outcomes
*   `IntelHub` isolated from the global environment.
*   50+ path references repaired (Nexus -> Sovereign).
*   A clean workbench for Campaign 05 (Sovereign Machine).
