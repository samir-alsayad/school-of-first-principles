# Campaign M01: Python Environment Mastery
**Pillar**: 01_foundation

## 🚀 Intent
To master the professional standard of Python environment isolation. This campaign focuses on moving away from "Global Pip" and establishing a sterile, per-project isolation protocol using `venv`, `uv`, and `pyproject.toml`.

## 📂 Structure
*   **[Foundry](foundry/)**: Intent, Specs, and Design.
*   **[Lab](lab/)**: Experimentation with `uv` and virtual environments.

## ⚙️ Outcomes
*   A locked-down global environment.
*   Standardized `.venv` at every project root.
*   Knowledge of `pip install -e` for internal project linkage.
