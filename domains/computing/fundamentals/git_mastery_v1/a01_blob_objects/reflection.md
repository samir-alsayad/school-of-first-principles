# Reflection: a01_blob_objects

## The Mirror
*Professor: "The map is not the territory. The filename is not the file."*

1.  If I have two identical files with different names, how many 'blob' objects does Git create?
2.  What happens to the hash if I change a single space in the file?
3.  Why is the first 2 characters of the hash used as a directory name? (Hint: Filesystem limits).

## My Notes
- **The Discovery**: [What surprised you?]
- **The Gap**: [What is still fuzzy?]

## Verified By
- [ ] Invariant: Content = Hash.
- [ ] Invariant: Git is a Key-Value Store.
