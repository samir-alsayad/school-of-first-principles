# Reflection: a06_recovery_reflog

## The Mirror
*Professor: "The Reflog is the record of your actions, not just the state of the code."*

1.  If I clone a repository, do I get the previous owner's `reflog`? Why not?
2.  How long does Git keep 'dangling' commits in its database before cleaning them up?
3.  Why is the `reflog` the ultimate tool for "Sovereign" developers?

## My Notes
- **The Discovery**: [What was the most 'magical' moment in this course?]
- **The Gap**: [What part of Git still feels like a black box?]

## Verified By
- [ ] Invariant: Reflog = Local History of HEAD Pointers.
- [ ] Invariant: Objects are persisted until `git gc`.
