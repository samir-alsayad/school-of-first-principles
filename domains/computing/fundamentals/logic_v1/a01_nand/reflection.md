# Reflection: NAND Logic
**Status**: [Pending | Verified]

## The Mirror
1. Why is the NAND gate called the "Universal Gate"?
> [Your answer here]

2. How did you create a NOT gate using only a NAND? (Describe the wiring).

## My Notes
[Observations about binary logic]

## The Discovery
[Lesson learned]

## The Gap
[How do we move from Logic (NAND) to Memory (Storing data)?]

## Evidence
