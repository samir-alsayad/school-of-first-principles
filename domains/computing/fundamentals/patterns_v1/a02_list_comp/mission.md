# Mission: List Comprehensions (The Filter)

## The Objective
In C, filtering an array takes a multi-line `for` loop.
In Python, we do it in one line.

## The Challenge
Create `filter_nums.py` that:
1.  Defines a list of numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
2.  Creates a NEW list `evens` containing only the even numbers.
3.  **Constraint**: You MUST do step 2 in ONE line of code.

## Hints
*   Syntax: `[x for x in data if condition]`
*   Modulo operator: `%`

## Verification
Output: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
