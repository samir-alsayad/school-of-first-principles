# Module 06: Shell Literacy
**Campaign**: 01 Foundation

## 🎓 Syllabus
"You are only as Sovereign as your ability to talk to the kernel."
This module covers the raw mechanics of the CLI that defined the Unix philosophy.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Scripting**: Shebangs (`#!/bin/bash`), Variables, and Control Flow.
- **Permissions**: Understanding `chmod`, `chown`, and the Sudo barrier.
- **Environment**: `$PATH`, `export`, and dotfiles.

## ⚛️ Atoms (Planned)
1.  **[01_the_shebang](./01_the_shebang/codex.md)**: Why `#!/bin/bash` matters.
2.  **[02_permission_matrix](./02_permission_matrix/codex.md)**: Decoding `rwx-r-x-r-x`.
3.  **[03_the_path](./03_the_path/codex.md)**: How the shell finds binaries.
