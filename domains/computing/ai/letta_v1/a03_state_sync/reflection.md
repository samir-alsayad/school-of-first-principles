# Reflection: a03_state_sync

## The Mirror
*Professor: "Agency is the ability to affect the world. Tools are the hands of the mind."*

1.  Why is providing 'write' access to an AI agent dangerous? How do we gate this?
2.  What happens if the YAML file is corrupted by the agent? (Hint: Git is our safety net).
3.  How does this approach maintain your "Sovereignty" compared to a cloud-based AI that stores your data in its own database?

## My Notes
- **The Discovery**: [How did it feel to see the AI change a file on your disk?]
- **The Gap**: [What part of the Python-to-Letta tool registration is still unclear?]

## Verified By
- [ ] Invariant: YAML state and Agent Memory are in sync.
- [ ] Invariant: Agent can perform I/O operations locally.
