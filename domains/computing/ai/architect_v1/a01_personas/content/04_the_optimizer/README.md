# Atom 04: Strategy with the Optimizer

## Objective
Configure the **Optimizer** to analyze progress and suggest "Advancement Paths".

## The Theory
The **Optimizer** looks at the **Velocity** of your learning. Its goal is to maximize your progress toward the "Sovereign Architect" title.

### Advancement Pathing
The Optimizer pings the Proposer when it sees you've mastered a concept.
- **Example**: "You've completed 3 Engine atoms with no Critic errors. Suggesting an 'Ultra-Long Context' stress test to solidify your VRAM math."

## The Experiment: Velocity Analytics
You will define a "Goal Alignment" rubric for the Optimizer to use when reviewing your session.

```markdown
### Optimizer Rubric
- [ ] Velocity: Atoms per hour.
- [ ] Error-to-Success Ratio.
- [ ] Depth: Did the learner explore the "Challenge" sections?
```

## Challenge
Teach the Optimizer to recognize "Boredom" (Learner skipping atoms too fast) and suggest a "Boss Fight" experiment as a gate to the next campaign.
