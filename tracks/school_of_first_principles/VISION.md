# The Grand Strategem

## 🔭 The Vision
To transition from "Learning" to "Sovereignty". The end state is a self-sufficient coding environment where **Nexus-Shell** replaces VSCode, powered by **Parallax** and local models, with the **School** serving as the onboard navigational system.

## 🏗️ Project Goals

### 1. Nexus-Shell (The Sovereign IDE)
*   **Goal**: VSCode Parity.
*   **Requirement**: Modular, configurable layouts (JSON-driven).
*   **Requirement**: "School Mode" — A specialized layout that puts the Curriculum (GAP Tutor) side-by-side with the Editor.
*   **Requirement**: Local Model Integration (Antigravity/LLM access within the shell).

### 2. Parallax (The Engine)
*   **Goal**: Indestructible Persistence.
*   **Requirement**: Fix the signal chain to ensure robust session management.
*   **Requirement**: Serve as the "Ghost" that keeps the Shell alive.

### 3. Gated Agent Protocol (The Law)
*   **Goal**: Safety & Alignment.
*   **Requirement**: Ensure local models follow strict protocols (ACLs, Gates).

## 🎮 The Gamification Layer
*   **Central Ledger**: A single source of truth for XP and Progress.
*   **Status**: Proposed (`XP_LEDGER.yaml` in root).
