# Intent: Campaign Creator Agent
**Module**: 01_campaign_creator
**Mission**: To build an intelligence module that helps the User scale the School independently.

## 1. The Goal
The **Campaign Creator** is an agentic pattern designed to take a "User Intent" (e.g., "I want to learn about Berlin real estate laws") and convert it into a full Sovereign Campaign:
*   **Foundry**: Intent, Spec, and Tasks.
*   **Lab**: Initial experiments and resources.
*   **Structure**: Automatic folder creation and README generation.

## 2. Technical Stack
*   **Logic**: RLM (Recursive Language Modeling) for task decomposition.
*   **Interface**: OpenCode TUI integration.
*   **Persistence**: Letta for remembering user goals and past campaign templates.

## 3. The "Handover" Milestone
This agent is the true "Exit Strategy." Once the user can summon the Campaign Creator to build a new domain 100% locally, the need for external IDEs disappears.
