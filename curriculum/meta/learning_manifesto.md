# Learning Manifesto

> **"I am not trying to learn more things. I am trying to make fewer unjustified assumptions."**

## 1. The Hard Truth
Learning does not happen when things work.
Learning happens when:
*   Expectations are broken.
*   Resistance is encountered.
*   Models do not fit observations.

**If it feels too smooth, I am not learning.**

## 2. The Goal
Not: *"I can write code."*
But: *"I can predict system behavior."*

## 3. Epistemic Hygiene
*   **Prediction is the gold standard.** If I cannot predict it, I do not understand it.
*   **Code is a probe.** We write code to ask the system a question.
*   **No Magic.** There is no "it just works". There is only mechanism and causality.

## 4. The Role of this Repository
This is a **Mental Model Archive**, not a code portfolio.
Folders represent **Questions**, not topics.
Start from zero. Assume nothing.
