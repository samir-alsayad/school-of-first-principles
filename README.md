# School of First Principles: The Schoolhouse (Curriculum Branch)

This is the **Instructional Only** branch of the School. It contains the complete Knowledge Graph but has been surgically stripped of all solution scripts to provide a pure "Starting Point" for students.

## The Challenge
Every directory in `domains/` contains technical instructions, requirements, and design templates. Your mission is to implement the code from scratch, following the **Protocol of Inquiry**.

## Features
- **Instructions Only**: Only `.md` and `.yaml` files remain in the content folders.
- **Mastery-First**: You cannot "run" the answers; you must write them.
- **Sovereign Engine**: The `school` CLI is included to help you track your progress.
