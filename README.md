# School of First Principles

> "I cannot create what I do not understand."

## Beyond Coding: The Path to Technical Mastery

The **School of First Principles** is not a tutorial series or a collection of snippets. It is a **Cognitive Operating System** designed to bridge the gap between "following instructions" and "internalized mastery."

In an age of automated tools and fragmented knowledge, this repository provides a rigorous, pedagogical framework for mastering software engineering from its most fundamental building blocks.

## 🎓 The Agentic Tutor Protocol

Learning here is governed by the **Agentic Tutor Ruleset**—a collaboration between human intelligence and AI personas:

- **The Professor**: Architect of the Knowledge Graph and cognitive dependencies.
- **The Tutor**: Socratic guide for implementation and troubleshooting.
- **The Architect**: Rigorous gatekeeper for system correctness and formal proofs.

## 🏛️ The Three-Branch Strategy

We use a tiered git architecture to separate your **Portfolio** from your **Education**:

- **`main`** (The Portfolio): The full state of your work. Includes infrastructure, curated instructions, and your verified solutions.
- **`curriculum`** (The Schoolhouse): A clean instructional slate. Stripped of solutions, this is where mastery is earned through fresh implementation.
- **`base`** (The Forge): Pure infrastructure. The CLI and Agentic rulesets only—ready to be populated with your own custom curriculum.

## 📂 The Architecture

### `domains/` (The Knowledge Graph)
A canonical library of disciplines (Computing, Intelligence, Life) mapped to atomic, verifiable assignments.

### `tracks/` (The Learning Journeys)
Custom-curated "playlists" of assignments (e.g., `nexus_shell`) that guide you through complex engineering campaigns.

### `src/` (The School Engine)
The `school` CLI: Your command center for tracking progress, submitting missions, and verifying mastery.

## 🚀 The Entry Sequence

You can enter the academy through two primary paths:

### Path A: The Structured Campaign (The Schoolhouse)
*Best for learners following the established Knowledge Graph.*
1.  **Branch**: Switch to the **`curriculum`** branch.
2.  **Initialize**: Load the **Agentic Tutor Ruleset** into your AI environment.
3.  **Select a Track**: Choose your campaign journey in `tracks/`.
4.  **Bootstrap**: Use the `school` CLI to initialize your learner profile.
5.  **Build**: Start with first principles and earn your mastery.

### Path B: The Direct Inquiry (The Forge)
*Best for creators building custom curriculum from scratch.*
1.  **Branch**: Switch to the **`base`** branch.
2.  **Initialize**: Load the **Agentic Tutor Ruleset** into your AI environment.
3.  **Declare Intent**: Simply tell the AI: *"I want to learn [X]"*.
4.  **Design**: The **Professor** persona will generate a custom track and curriculum specs for you.
5.  **Execute**: Follow the Socratic guidance of the **Tutor** to build your project.
