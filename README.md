## The Structure (Cognitive Mirror)

This repository is organized to match how your brain works:

### 1. `workbench/` (Working Memory)
**The Active Zone.**
*   Here lies the **one** experiment you are currently solving.
*   Goal: Zero friction. No folder diving.
*   *Action:* Coding happens here.

### 2. `library/` (Long-Term Memory)
**The Archive.**
*   When a concept is mastered, it moves here.
*   Organized by First Principles:
    *   `library/representation/` (Bits, Numbers)
    *   `library/computation/` (Functions, Algorithms)
    *   `library/systems/` (IPC, Sockets)
    *   `library/state/` (Immutability, Memory)

### 3. `curriculum/` (Executive Function)
**The Plan.**
*   `curriculum/meta/concept_map.md`: The Map.
*   `curriculum/meta/protocols/`: The Rules of Engagement.

## How to Learn
1.  Check `task.md` (in your brain) for the next mission.
2.  Agent prepares `workbench/`.
3.  You solve the puzzle.
4.  We verify and move it to `library/`.
