# Sovereign User Curriculum (The Handover Path)

This is the verified path to Total Independence.

## ✅ M01: The Sovereign Point (Milestone)
*Status: Ready*
- **Atom 1.1**: Model Verification (VRAM & Inference Check)
- **Goal**: Verify the M4 Pro can hold the "Sovereign Duo" (Qwen + DeepSeek).

## ✅ M04: Local Anchoring (Infrastructure)
*Status: Ready for Execution*
- **Atom 4.1**: Binary Discovery (Finding `psql`)
- **Atom 4.2**: Database Genesis (Identity & Rights)
- **Atom 4.3**: The Vector Key (`pgvector` compilation)
- **Gate 4.4**: Anchoring Letta (Foundry Assembly)

## 🚧 M05: Sentry Jail (Security)
*Status: To Be Designed*
The "Identity Firewall" is not enough. We need a "Process Jail" to safely run agent-generated code.
- **Atom 5.1: The Chroot Pattern**: Creating the isolation folder (`/tmp/jail`).
- **Atom 5.2: The Warden**: Writing the python wrapper (`warden.py`) that strictly limits subprocess calls.
- **Atom 5.3: Checkpoint Charlie**: Verifying that `warden.py` blocks network and unauthorized reads.
- **Gate 5.4**: The Jailbreak Test (Foundry Assembly).

## 🚧 M06: Council Ignition (Intelligence)
*Status: To Be Designed*
Bootstrapping the specialized agents using the local stack.
- **Atom 6.1: The Roll Call**: Defining the GAP Manifests for Librarian, Tutor, Critic.
- **Atom 6.2: The Knowledge Injection**: Loading the `school-of-first-principles` curriculum into the Librarian's memory.
- **Atom 6.3: The GAP Connector**: Connecting Letta agents to the GAP "Enforcer" tool.
- **Gate 6.4**: The First Council (Foundry Assembly).

## 🏁 M07: The Handover (Victory)
*Status: To Be Designed*
The final verification that the User is Sovereign.
- **Atom 7.1**: The Disconnect (Unplug Ethernet).
- **Atom 7.2**: The Full Cycle (Plan -> Design -> Code -> Verify).
- **Gate 7.3**: The Sovereign Charter (Signing the Declaration).
