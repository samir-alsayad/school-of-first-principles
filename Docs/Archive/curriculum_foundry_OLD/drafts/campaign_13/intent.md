# Charity: Campaign 13 - Protocol Design
# Gate I: Intent (The Charter)
# Status: DRAFT

## 1. Context
We need a protocol to enforce the "Deferred Design Pattern" for complex campaigns.
Current School protocols (Learning/Foundry) cover the *parts*, but not the *orchestration* of a full campaign that requires learning before designing.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
id: school-campaign-v1-charter
requirements:
  - **REQ-01**: The protocol SHALL enforce a 4-Gate State Machine (Charter -> Skills -> Design -> Delivery).
  - **REQ-02**: WHEN the Charter is initialized, the Design Section SHALL be empty (or explicitly marked as "DEFERRED").
  - **REQ-03**: The protocol SHALL enable the user to branch into `school-learning-v1` modules during the Skills Phase.
  - **REQ-04**: The protocol SHALL require a valid EARS Spec and Casting Guide before entering the Delivery Phase.

## 3. Design Spec
<!-- DEFERRED: We do not know the architecture yet. We must learn first. -->
[ ] GAP Manifest Structure?
[ ] Gate Logic?
[ ] Directory Layout?
