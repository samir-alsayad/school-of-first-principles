# Campaign Archetypes: The Sovereign Curriculum Matrix

We identified that "One size does not fit all." The Protocol must adapt to your **Starting Knowledge** and your **End Goal**.

## The 4 Cardinal Archetypes

### 1. The Surveyor (Discovery Campaign) 🔭
*   **Context**: "I don't know what exists yet."
*   **Goal**: Map the territory. Filter the signal from the noise.
*   **Knowledge Level**: Low (Unconscious Incompetence).
*   **Output**: **The Codex** (A curated list/database).

### 2. The Analyst (Evaluation Campaign) 🧐
*   **Context**: "I see the list, but I don't understand the value."
*   **Goal**: Decipher implications, strengths, and weaknesses. "How to read a model card."
*   **Output**: **The Framework** (Heuristics for judgment) and **The Review** (Deep dive analysis).

### 3. The Initiate (Skill Campaign) 🥋
*   **Context**: "I know what exists, but I can't do it yet."
*   **Goal**: Acquire a specific capability.
*   **Knowledge Level**: Medium (Conscious Incompetence).
*   **Example**: *"Postgres Mastery"*, *"Learn Rust"*.
*   **Deliverable**:
    *   **The Cheat Sheet**: A condensed reference for your future self.
    *   **The Kata**: A repeatable exercise (e.g., "Build a B-Tree from scratch").
    *   **The Mental Model**: Notes explaining *why* it works.

### 4. The Architect (Construction Campaign) 🏗️
*   **Context**: "I have the skills. I need the tool."
*   **Goal**: Build a production asset for a Project.
*   **Knowledge Level**: High (Conscious Competence).
*   **Example**: *"Build the Nexus-Shell Event Bus"*.
*   **Deliverable**:
    *   **The Casting**: Production-ready code poured into the Project.
    *   **The Manual**: User documentation.

### 5. The Scientist (Research Campaign) 🔬
*   **Context**: "I have a hypothesis. I need the truth."
*   **Goal**: Answer a specific question through experimentation.
*   **Knowledge Level**: Expert (Unconscious Competence).
*   **Example**: *"Does quantization hurt reasoning performance?"*
*   **Deliverable**:
    *   **The Paper**: A report with data, charts, and conclusions.
    *   **The Verdict**: A "Law" added to your personal knowledge base.

## The Protocol Implication
The **Deferred Design Pattern** works perfectly for a "Grand Campaign" that moves through these stages:
1.  **Phase 1 (Scout)**: Find the models. (Output: List).
2.  **Phase 2 (Initiate)**: Learn how they work. (Output: Notes).
3.  **Phase 3 (Architect)**: Design the filter tool. (Output: Spec).
4.  **Phase 4 (Build)**: Build the tool. (Output: Code).
