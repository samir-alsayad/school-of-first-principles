# The Sovereign Manifesto: The Grand Map of Interests
**Status**: Living Document
**Goal**: To organize the "Meta Project" -> A system that governs all creative and technical pursuits of the Sovereign.

## 1. The Core Philosophy
*   **The Meta Project**: Collect all data (logs, works, ideas), organize it, and create agents to assist in every domain.
*   **Data Sovereignty**: "The Big Data Recycling". Recapturing ownership of all personal data (Google, Maps, Email) into a structure owned by the User.
*   **Local & Open**: Zero reliance on walled gardens (Apple, Google). Transition to Open Source & Local Tech.

## 2. The Domain Map (Campaigns)
We map these interests to the **Grand Campaigns**.

### 🏛️ 01. Sovereign Foundation (The Toolbelt)
*   **Goal**: Mastery of the "Big Tools". python, env management, shell, disk management, nvim "mouseless" usage.
*   **Context**: Building the skillsets required to maintain the rest of the stack.

### 🧠 02. Sovereign Intelligence (The Mind)
*   **The Meta-Brain**: Using AI to organize the "Life Data".
*   **Campaign Creator**: A meta-agent to help build and scale the School.

### 🗣️ 04. Sovereign Interface (The Interaction)
*   **Nexus Shell / Parallax**: The terminal-based command center.
*   **Graph Coding**: Mermaid diagrams + AI for planning and architectural docs.

### ⚙️ 05. Sovereign Machine (The Handover)
*   **Goal**: Total hardware autonomy (M1 + M4 Cluster).
*   **Exit Strategy**: Moving from Cloud IDEs to Local TUI. ASAP Handover.

### 🌿 06. Personal Sovereignty (The Life)
*   **Goal**: Health (Mother/Self), Finances, Berlin Flat-hunt, General Org.
*   **Action**: Creating workout plans, flat trackers, and financial spreadsheets via autonomous agents.

## 3. The Protocol Update: Cumulative Modules
*   **Insight**: Modules are not always isolated. They build on each other.
*   **Concept**: **The Rolling Foundry**.
    *   *Module A (Math)*: Creates a `geometry.py` library.
    *   *Module B (Blender)*: Imports `geometry.py` to script procedural art.
    *   *Module C (Review)*: Analyzes the art.
    *   *Gate IV (The Pour)*: A massive PR that combines A+B+C into a final "Art Film".
