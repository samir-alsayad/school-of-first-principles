# The Agentic Academy Taxonomy (v1.1)

## 1. The Hierarchy (Domain-Driven)
We organize knowledge into a strict, canonical taxonomy that mirrors technical systems and skills.

| Level | Term | Definition | Folder Syntax | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Domain** | The broad field of study. | `domain/` | `computing` |
| **2** | **Discipline** | A specialized branch of a domain. | `discipline/` | `systems` |
| **3** | **Module** | A project or unit of theory (v1+). | `module_v[n]/` | `memory_v1` |
| **4** | **Assignment** | A discrete, verifiable project. | `a01_[name]/` | `a01_postgres` |

## 2. The Implementation Protocol (Flows)
All significant work must follow a strictly phased inquiry loop:
- **Flow A (Developing Content)**: Professors create Curriculum (Specs -> Tasks -> Verification).
- **Flow B (Developing Systems)**: Architects/Students build Systems (Requirements -> Design -> Tasks).

## 3. The Roles
The Agentic Academy is governed by three specific personas:

- **The Professor (Meta-Flow)**: Curriculum designer. Focuses on cognitive dependencies and mission architecture.
- **The Tutor (Execution-Flow)**: Socratic guide. Focuses on guided implementation and error handling.
- **The Architect (Production Gatekeeper)**: Rigorous engineer. Focuses on formal proofs, invariants, and system correctness.

## 4. Calibration
All work is calibrated by **The Dial**:
1. **Explorative (Blink)**: Mental models and visibility.
2. **Architectural (System)**: Reliable infrastructure and state.
3. **Verifiable (Sovereign)**: Formal proofs and absolute invariants.
