# The School of First Principles Taxonomy (v1.0)

## 1. The Hierarchy (The 4 Layers)
We organize knowledge into nested containers. Every container represents a specific **Type of Goal**.

| Level | Term | Definition | Goal Type | Universal Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Domain** | The broad area of interest. | **Identity** (Who am I?) | `Musician` |
| **2** | **Campaign** | A continuous journey to master a skill set. | **Competence** (What can I do?) | `Guitar Mastery` |
| **3** | **Module** | A finite project with a verifiable end. | **Artifact** (What have I built?) | `Perform "Wonderwall" live` |
| **4** | **Atom** | The indivisible unit of learning. | **Insight** (What did I grasp?) | `G-Major Chord Shape` |

### 1B. Atomic Types
Atoms come in two flavors:
*   **Concept Atom**: Theory only. `Codex` + `Reflection`. (e.g., Music Theory, Postgres Anatomy).
*   **Action Atom**: Theory + Proof. `Codex` + `Discovery` + `Reflection`. (e.g., Play a C-Chord, Install Postgres).

## 2. The Campaign Map (The Territory)
The canonical mapping of Campaigns to numbers.

| ID | Name | Focus | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Foundation** | The Toolbelt (Shell, Python, Git). | Active |
| **02** | **Intelligence** | The Mind (LLMs, RLM, Agents). | Active |
| **03** | **Memory** | The Archive (Postgres, Vectors). | Planned |
| **04** | **Interface** | The Interaction (TUI, Shells). | Planned |
| **05** | **Sovereign User** | **The Handover** (Cloud Decoupling). | **Active** |
| **06** | **Personal** | The Life (Health, Finance, Org). | Passive |
| **07** | **Hardware** | The Vessel (Robotics, Scriptum). | Planned |
| **08** | **Academia** | The Institution (University). | Passive |
| **09** | **Studio** | The Creation (Music, Art). | Future |

## 3. The Roles (The Council)
The distinct personas of the AI Agents.

*   **The Librarian (Memory)**: Curates the context. Holds the history and file paths.
*   **The Tutor (Instruction)**: Socratic guide. Manages the `codex`/`reflection` loop.
*   **The Critic (Trajectory)**: Analyzes the path. Proposes better workflows and optimizations to reach the Goal faster.

## 4. The Gap Protocol (Core vs. Sovereign)
*   **Protocols (HOW)**: Universal rules and logic (e.g., `instructional`, `analytical`). Located in `GAP/protocols`.
*   **Domains (WHERE)**: Specific contexts and data (e.g., `school-of-first-principles`). Located in `GAP/domains`.
