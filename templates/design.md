# Start From Scratch Design Template
<!-- CONSTRAINT: Do not assume any pre-existing libraries. -->
<!-- CONSTRAINT: Design must proceed from primitive to complex. -->

## 1. Traceability
- **Intent**: [Link to Requirements]

## 2. The Abstraction Stack
Define the layers you will build.

### Layer 1: Primitive
- [ ] Define the smallest unit.

### Layer 2: Composite
- [ ] How units combine.

## 3. Pedagogical Checks
- [ ] Is there any "magic" black box? (If yes, break it down).
- [ ] Can a student build this in 1 week?
